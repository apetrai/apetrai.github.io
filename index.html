    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
    <p class="beginning">Hi, I’m Angelo, I’m 16 years old and I’m passionate about software
    and I have been teaching myself web technologies like HTML, CSS,
    and JavaScript and especially low level programming such as C++. If
    you would like to take a look, please visit my GitHub account here
    to view all of my projects. I aspire to become a software engineer
    and I’m currently looking for the right opportunity. Thank you.</p>
